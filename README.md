# CPU Scheduling Simulator

## Overview

The CPU Scheduling Simulator is a web-based tool that implements various CPU scheduling algorithms, including First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), and Priority Preemptive Scheduling. It provides detailed visualizations and metrics to analyze the performance of each algorithm.

## Features

- **Algorithms Implemented:**
  - First Come First Serve (FCFS)
  - Shortest Job First (SJF)
  - Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
  - Priority Preemptive Scheduling

- **Visualizations:**
  - **Gantt Chart:** Visual representation of process execution order.
  - **Timeline Chart:** Displays each process's state changes over time.
  - **Time Log:** Detailed log of process state transitions.
  - **Final Table:** Summarizes key metrics like Arrival Time, Burst Time, Completion Time, Turnaround Time, Waiting Time, and Response Time.
  - **Comparison Chart:** Allows comparison of average metrics across different algorithms.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Visualization:** Google Charts
